## 2024-05-24 – Unauthenticated User Registration Bypass via Google Login
**Vulnerability:** The Google Login feature in `includes/Google_Login.php` allowed new user accounts to be created even when WordPress user registration (`users_can_register`) was disabled. This happened because the `login_or_register_user` method created a new user if one didn't exist, without checking the global site setting.
**Learning:** Third-party authentication integrations must always respect the core platform's registration policies. Just because a user authenticates via Google/SSO doesn't mean they are authorized to create an account on the local system.
**Prevention:** Always check `get_option('users_can_register')` before programmatically creating users in authentication flows. If registration is disabled, either reject the login attempt or fail gracefully (e.g., redirect to login with error).
